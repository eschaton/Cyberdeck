///
/// Since a Cyber 180 Central Processor instruction can be either 16 or 32 bits, there can be between 2 and 4 instructions per 64-bit word.
///
/// The size/type are determined by the opcode; always use ``Cyber180CPInstructionAdvance`` to determine the true size of a fetched instruction.
///
/// - Note: The documentation says that, for `SjkiD` instructions, the opcode and S are 5 and 3 bits respectively, but everything works out better if they're 4 and 4. Other places in the documentation even treat them as 4 and 4 (e.g. `LBYTS` and `SBYTS` are documented as `DSjkiD` and refer to `S` as being in the range `0` through `F`).
