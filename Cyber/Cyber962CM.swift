/// A Cyber962CM emulates the Central Memory in the Cyber 962.
///
/// The Central Memory in the Cyber 962 has eight banks of 8KW to 32MW each, and is interacted with via multiple ports that allow simultaneous CP and PP access. The CM also has a bounds register that limits writes from any or all ports. Finally, there is also a maintenance chaannel interface that provides access to the maintenance registers via a PP for initialization, diagnostics, error reporting and correction, and for manipulating the bounds register.
